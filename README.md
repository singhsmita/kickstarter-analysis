# Analysis of Outcomes based on goals and launch date

## Overview of Project
Louise , an upcoming playwright wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.By bringing into use  Excel to organize, sort, and analyze Kickstarter data we can determine  and visualize campaign outcomes.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to help Louise determine whether there are specific factors that make a project's campaign successful.We are analysing outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals in this scenario.Visualization such as Bar Chart and Line chart would generate additional insight.

## Analysis and Challenges
Analysis in this specific case is determined based on two factors;-
->Analysis of Outcomes based on Launch Date
->Analysis of Outcomes based on Goal.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May. However, January, June, July and October all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched.This can be determined by examining the points along the trend lines of the chart.It was  found that while there are a  total of 4114 Kickstarter campaigns , the "theater" category is the most popular which sums up to a total of 1393,which contributes to 33.8% of the campaign.Also,Theater category had 839 successful shows which is  61% success rate in Theater category and contributes to 20.3% of the Kickstarter campaign.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The campaigns where the goal was below 14999 has more successful campaigns.The rate of success ranges between 76 % - 50%.
But with the increase in goal amount,there were more failed campaigns .It was also seen that some campaigns which needed huge funds  were active only for a few days,which could have been a possible reason of failure.Possibly,if the campaigns were active for a longer period it would have better chances of success.


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Although we were analysing outcomes based on Launch Date and Goal,other details had to be taken into consideration to see a co-relation between relevant information.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
* May/June seems to be a good month to launch a campaign.
* we can determine that theater is a popular and successful type of campaign overall

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The success rate of the campaign was higher when the Goal was below $15000.There were more failed campaigns than successful after the Goal increased beyond $15000.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

 limitations include a limited sample size , lack of reliable data such as self-reported data, missing data.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could help Louise to understand the trends by analysing the data based on the following comparisons:-
* Establish a relation between  category/sub category and country.
* Establish a relation between Category/subcategory and year to see if there was a growing or a setting trend of any category over the years.
Both these comparisons can be drawn using a pivot table and pivot chart(Bar / Line) to study the trend.
